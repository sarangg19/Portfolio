React Vite demo for your portfolio

How to run:

1. Copy these files into place (you're already in `e:\New folder`).
2. Copy your images into `react-app/src/assets/`:
   - `sarang-post.jpeg`
   - `redhat-image.png`
   - `cousera-image.png`
3. From PowerShell run:

```powershell
cd "e:\New folder\react-app"
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open the URL printed by Vite (usually http://localhost:5173) to see the React app.

If you'd like, I can run `npm install` and start the dev server here, but that will install packages on your machine. Say the word and I'll proceed.
